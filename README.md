# WinLinuxMimicryStack

I now have a Windows system, unfortunately. Here are some things to install to make a Windows system as Linux as possible. Yes, this is indeed an unfortunate circumstance. No, it's not as easy to just install and use a real Linux distro as you're imagining. I will be updating this document if and when I come up with more.

WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) [https://www.itprotoday.com/linux-os/how-to-use-windows-subsystem-for-linux](https://www.itprotoday.com/linux-os/how-to-use-windows-subsystem-for-linux)

### ***Alternatively***

VirtualBox
```
$ winget install virtualbox
```

but that's kinda cheating.

# Discontinuation

35 days. that's 1 month and 4 days. that's how long I could stand trying to use Windows before I couldn't bare it any longer and had to move back to linux, whatever the cost. this repo is therefore archived, development will not continue.

be back soon, to either Trisquel, Ubuntu MATE, or Xubuntu's newest releases.

and a big ol' fuck you to vibe coding.
